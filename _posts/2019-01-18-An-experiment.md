title: An experiment about improving my productivity
---
How time flies! 2018 is gone. I have the feeling that the year 2018 is one of the most important years of my life. I finished my master thesis and thesis defense. I decided not to stay in academia but directly find a job and keep learning while working.

To be honest, I am not very happy with my productivity at the beginning of 2019. I played too much computer games and spent a lot of time watching the gaming stream to improve my gaming skills. But yeah, I know I must get well-prepared for the coming job interviews. How to improve my productivity becomes the main issue for me in January.

Luckily, I find a very interesting [article](https://sspai.com/post/52270) on a Chinese website. The author in the article talks about how he designed a task system that encourages him to study or work more efficiently and avoid wasting time.

In general, the task system contains a GTD software, a tomato timer, and an app called [playtask](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/playtask/id1050090187?mt=8). The GTD software records everything that takes more than 2 minutes to finish. The tomato timer forces users to focus on one task for 25 minutes then take a 5-minute rest. The key app here is playtask. In the app, there are three lists. One list is for daily task. One list is for the weekly task. And the last one is called a desire list. Users firstly set daily tasks and weekly tasks with corresponding points. As for me, I added reading books for at least 20 minutes to the daily list. It has a point of 2. Once a task is done, click that task in the app and the users will get corresponding points. In the desire list, users also write down things they want to do but not supposed to do. Each thing corresponds to a point cost. For example, I wrote down drinking non-sugarfree soft drinks (500 ml) with a cost of 5. So I need to read books for 3 days to obtain 6 points, then I can drink coke. :)

In my mind, everyone knows smoking is unhealthy, eating too much sugar is bad. However, it is hard quitting smoking or eating less sugar. Why? My understanding is that these things' effect is time-delayed. People can't see how their lung changes after smoking 1 cigarette. Lung cancer happens after they smoke for many years. However, this system task somehow evaluates the benefits of good habits and the cost of bad habits and directly shows them to users. Of course, it depends on the design of the system. For example, how hard it is to gain points and how much cost it is to do things in the desire list. The system becomes meaningless if reading a book for 20 minutes gains 10 points while smoking only takes 1 point.

But basically, that's why this system really attracts me. I decided to build my own task system and see how it works on me.

I have been using [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) for around 1 year. I am now getting used to it. So I chose it as the GTD software in my task system. For the tomato timer, I used [Pomotodo](https://pomotodo.com/intl/en/). Based on these two apps and playtask app, my workday workflow is listed below.

1. Go to office/university library and check tasks in OmniFocus using two perspectives. One is the default perspective Forecast. Another is self-defined perspective called Office. 

2. Add the checked tasks in the Pomotodo and start to work on them. Once I get new tasks from my boss or from my colleagues. I will add the tasks to the OmniFocus inbox.

3. After lunchtime, organize the tasks in the inbox, for example, giving tasks deadlines and tagging them. 

4. Before leaving office, check the finished tomato timer in Pomodoro and finished / unfinished tasks in OmniFocus. Also, check the playtask app. Finished tasks give me more points. 

5. During the entire day, before I do something in the desire list, I will open that app and decrease the points I have.

Here are the good habits and bad habits in my playtask app.

I started this system on the 17th of Jan. I will update this post after 1 week, 1 month and 3 months writing down the progress and feelings.

I do believe that using modern task management apps help people work and study more efficiently. But If a man has no self-discipline, no matter how apps are developed, he still doesn't have any control over his life.

***Updates on 1st, Feb***

Finally I got some time updating this post. In general, this system helps to me smoke less and drink more water everyday. It is still a bit hard for me to sleep early. But at least for now, this system works
