# About

I am currently working at Lidl department Advanced-Analytics as a junior data scientist. I finished my computer science master at FU Berlin with a specialization in machine learning and deep learning. During my master study, I was a student assistant in workgroup mathematics of machine learning

As a data scientist, Python is my primary programming language. Numpy, Pandas, sklearn, Matplotlib are Python libraries that I use every day. As for the deep learning framework I use Keras. My work duty also includes backend programming using Flask and sqlachemy. In my free time, I enjoy doing leetcode in Python. So far I have finished more than 400 leetcode problems.

I can also program in Java and Javascript. Recently I started to do leetcode in both Java and Python. 

I would like to use this blog not only to note down tech-problems I encounter and how I solve them but also to share the paper or books I recently read.
