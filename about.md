# About

I am currently working at Lyft as a software engineer. Before I was a data scientist at Lidl. I finished my computer science master at FU Berlin with a specialization in machine learning and deep learning. During my master study, I was a student assistant in workgroup mathematics of machine learning

Python is my primary programming language. Numpy, Pandas, sklearn, Matplotlib are Python libraries that I use every day. As for the deep learning framework I use Keras. I also have experience in backend development using Flask and Fastapi. In my free time, I enjoy doing leetcode in Python. So far I have finished 500 leetcode problems.

I can also program in Javascript. I learned React in my free time. I am planning to learn more in frontend and in the future become a full-stack developer with machine learning and deep learning knowledge equipped.

I would like to use this blog not only to note down tech-problems I encounter and how I solve them but also to share the paper or books I recently read.
